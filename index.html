      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently in the process of learning the skills to become a software developer. With a background in non-profit, I have become interested in web development lately in hopes to land a developer job or something similar. I am currently enrolled in the University of Denver Coding Boot Camp. I am excited to start this new journey!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>"When people ask me where I come from, to see what that says about man.<br>I only end up giving bad directions, that never lead them there at all." <br>Dawes in "Time Spent in Los Angelas." <p> I am originally from Dayton, OH. I lived outside of Louisville, KY for 10 years of my life so depending on the context those can be interchanging. The short answer is, Dayton, OH.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Music, photography, skateboarding, hanging out with my wife and cats.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be running a photography business with my wife while I do web development freelance work on the side.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Denver, CO</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love the creative process from begining with an idea and building that idea to something tangible. I love problem solving and being able to see more of how the internet works.</p>
